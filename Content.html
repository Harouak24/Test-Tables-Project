		<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. Created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009, the game was officially released in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development around then. Minecraft has since been ported to various platforms and become the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold across all platforms and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.</p>
		<p>In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.</p>
		<p>Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest and most influential video games of all time, being inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in June 2020. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual MineCon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.</p>

    	<p>Minecraft: Story Mode, an episodic spin-off game developed by Telltale Games in collaboration with Mojang, was announced in December 2014. Consisting of five episodes plus three additional downloadable episodes, the standalone game is a narrative and player choice-driven, and it was released on Windows, OS X, iOS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One via download on 13 October 2015.[179][180][181] A physical disc that grants access to all episodes was released for the aforementioned four consoles on 27 October.[181] Wii U [182] and Nintendo Switch version were also later released [183][184] The first trailer for the game was shown at MineCon on 4 July 2015, revealing some of the game's features. In Minecraft: Story Mode, players control Jesse (voiced by Patton Oswalt and Catherine Taber),[181] who sets out on a journey with his or her friends to find The Order of the Stone—four adventurers who slayed an Ender Dragon—in order to save their world. Brian Posehn, Ashley Johnson, Scott Porter, Martha Plimpton, Dave Fennoy, Corey Feldman, Billy West and Paul Reubens portray the rest of the cast.[185]</p>

		<p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no specific goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[19] However, there is an achievement system,[20] known as "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game. Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option for third-person perspective.[21] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[22] Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic;[23] liquids continuously flow for a limited horizontal distance from source blocks, which can be removed by placing a solid block in its place or by scooping it into a bucket. The game also contains a material known as redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.[24]</p>
		<p>The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player).[25][26][27] There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical problems when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30,000,000 blocks from the center.[i] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller sections called "chunks" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby.[25] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[28][29] the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and various lava/water bodies.[27] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, and one full cycle lasts 20 real-time minutes.</p>
		<p>New players have a randomly selected default character skin of either Steve or Alex,[32] but the option to create custom skins was made available in 2010.[33] Players encounter various non-player characters known as mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures.[34] Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs—including large spiders, skeletons, and zombies—spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves.[27] Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear.[35] Other creatures unique to Minecraft include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks).[36] There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk variants that spawn in deserts.[37] Minecraft has two alternative dimensions besides the overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End.[36] The Nether is a hell-like dimension accessed via player-built portals; it contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 traveled in the overworld.[38] The player can build an optional boss mob called the Wither out of materials found in the Nether.[39] The End is a barren land consisting of many islands. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon dwells on the main island.[40] Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which upon entering cues the game's ending credits and a poem written by Irish novelist Julian Gough.[41] Players are then teleported back to their spawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.[42]</p>

		<p>In September 2019, The Guardian classified Minecraft as the best video game of (the first two decades of) the 21st century,[282] and in November 2019 Polygon called the game the "most important game of the decade" in its 2010s "decade in review".[283] In December 2019, Forbes gave Minecraft a special mention in a list of the best video games of the 2010s, stating that the game is "without a doubt one of the most important games of the last ten years."[284] In June 2020, Minecraft was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.[285]</p>
		<p>Social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit played a significant role in popularizing Minecraft.[286] Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one-third of Minecraft players learned about the game via Internet videos.[287] In 2010, Minecraft-related videos began to gain influence on YouTube, often made by commentators. The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs.[288] Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over four million Minecraft-related YouTube videos had been uploaded.[289] Some popular commentators have received employment at Machinima, a gaming video company that owns a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube.[288] The Yogscast is a British company that regularly produces Minecraft videos; their YouTube channel has attained billions of views, and their panel at MineCon 2011 had the highest attendance.[288][290] Other well known YouTube personnel include Jordan Maron, who has created many Minecraft parodies, including "Minecraft Style", a parody of the internationally successful single "Gangnam Style" by South Korean rapper Psy.[291]</p>
		<p>Herobrine is a major community icon of Minecraft, who first appeared as a single image on 4chan's /v/ board. According to rumors, Herobrine appears in players' worlds and builds strange constructions.[292] However, Mojang has confirmed that Herobrine has never existed in Minecraft, and there are no plans to add Herobrine.[293]</p>
		<p>Minecraft has been referenced by other video games, such as Torchlight II, Borderlands 2, Choplifter HD, Super Meat Boy, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, The Binding of Isaac, The Stanley Parable, and FTL: Faster Than Light.[294][295] It was also referenced by electronic music artist deadmau5 in his performances.[296] A simulation of the game was featured in Lady Gaga's "G.U.Y." music video.[297] The game is also referenced heavily in "Informative Murder Porn", the second episode of the seventeenth season of the animated television series South Park.[298] "Luca$", the seventeenth episode of the 25th season of the animated sitcom The Simpsons was inspired by Minecraft.[299]</p>

    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			<strong>Survival mode:</strong><br>
                In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[27] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night.[27] The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from monsters, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events. Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game, except in peaceful difficulty. If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete.[31] Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.

                Players can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft.[43] Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools, which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. Players can construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores, and convert materials into other materials.[44] Players may also exchange goods with villager Non-player characters through a trading system, which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.[45][34]

                The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items. Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped, and players re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game, and can be reset by sleeping in a bed[46] or using a respawn anchor.[47][better source needed] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear, or despawn, after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons.[30] Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.[30]
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			<strong>Hardcore mode:</strong><br>
                Hardcore mode is a survival mode variant that is locked to the hardest setting and has permadeath.[48] If a player dies in a hardcore world, they are no longer allowed to interact with it, so they can either be put into spectator mode and explore the world or delete it entirely.[49]
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			<strong>Creative mode:</strong><br>
    			In creative mode, players have access to all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu, and can place or remove them instantly.[50] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger.[51][52] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.[50]
    		</li>
    		<li>
    		    <strong>Adventure mode:</strong><br>
    		    Adventure mode was designed specifically so that players could experience user-crafted custom maps and adventures.[53][54][55] Gameplay is similar to survival mode but with various restrictions, which can be applied to the game world by the creator of the map. This forces players to obtain the required items and experience adventures in the way that the map maker intended.[55] Another addition designed for custom maps is the command block; this block allows map makers to expand interactions with players through scripted server commands.[56]
    	    </li>
    		<li>
    		    <strong>Spectator mode:</strong><br>
    		    Spectator mode allows players to fly through blocks and watch gameplay without directly interacting. Players do not have an inventory, but can teleport to other players and view from the perspective of another player or creature.[57] This game mode can only be accessed within the Java or PC edition.
